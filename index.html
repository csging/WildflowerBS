Hysterectomies are done through minimally invasive techniques unless the uterus is too large or there are other masses or complications requiring a larger incision.  The preferred method, if possible, is to remove the uterus vaginally.  Vaginal hysterectomy has been shown to have the lowest complication rate.

        Abnormal PAP Smears/HPV

      </h5>

    <div id="collapse15" class="collapse">
      <div class="card-body text-center"><p>A PAP smear is a scraping of skin like cells from the cervix that are sent to a  lab and evaluated  for signs of precancerous or malignant cells.  PAP smears should start at 21 year of age regardless of sexual activity,  PAP smears are repeated depending on age and the results of the last PAP smear and are done every 1 to 3 years until  at least the age of 65.  Additional co-testing for HPV ( Human Papilloma Virus) after the age of 30, if neg, may allow up to 5 years between PAP smears.</p>
      <p>PAP smears are abnormal if they show pre-cancer or cancerous cells. These abnormalities are caused by the Human Papilloma Virus.   Abnormal cells types are separated into 3 main categories: Mild pre-cancer, Severe pre-cancer and Cancer.  Each category has various different names that can be confusing but they all are the same category:</p>
      <p>Mildly abnormal cells can be called:
          ASCUS (Atypical Cells of Uncertain Significance)  
          Mild Dysplasia
          CIN 1  (Cervical Intra-epithelial Neoplasia 1)
          LGSIL ( Low Grade Intra-epithelial Neoplasia)</p>
      <p>Severely abnormal cells can be called:

              CIN 2 to 3 (Cervical Intra-epithelial Neoplasia 2 to 3)
              HGSIL ( High Grade Squamous Inter-epithelial Lesions)

      <p>When abnormalities are found in gland cells, (Atypical Glandular Cells), it is more worrisome than the Squamous (skin like ) cells.  Abnormal glands cells can progress to cancer more quickly.</p>
      <p>The treatment or follow up of abnormal PAP smears is also less aggressive in women from 21 to 30 years of age as the immune system is so robust that the cells will most likely return to normal.  Surgery to remove abnormal cells from he cervix can weaken and lead to pregnancy loss or premature delivery of an infant.  In most cases, even in women over 30 years of age,  these cells can be carefully watched with PAP smears and biopsies without any other intervention as long as they do not become severely abnormal</p>

The biopsies feel like a pinch or a cramp and the sample is sent to pathology and evaluated for pre-cancer or cancer cells. Taking Motrin before the procedure makes it more comfortable.

        Ovarian Cysts

    <div id="collapse18" class="collapse">
      <div class="card-body text-center">
        <p> Cysts are fluid filled sacs and often occur naturally on the ovary before it releases an egg.  Sometimes the cysts become enlarged and can cause pelvic pressure or sudden and prolonged pain.  They can even cause the ovary to twist, lose its blood supply, resulting in damage or the loss of an ovary.  They are very common in child bearing years. </p>
        <p>Cysts are benign about 99% of the time before menopause.  They are usually diagnosed by imaging such as an Ultrasound or CT scan.  They usually resolve on their own.  If they are not causing symptoms, it is safe to watch them most of the time. Often, we recommend repeating an ultrasound every few months to see if it is getting smaller. If the cyst requires removal, it can usually be done through small incisions with a scope, as an outpatient.</p>

      <p>Abnormal Vaginal Bleeding can be caused by clotting abnormalities.  Irregularity of periods should always be reported to your doctor so that an appropriate investigation can be recommended if indicated.

Most often it is a self limited diagnosis such as an ovarian cyst that has leaked fluid, that will dissolve on its own.  If the pain is severe and persistent and not relieved in a  short time or with over the counter medications, it will probably require further investigation at the office or in the emergency room if it is severe.  It is most important to seek urgent care if you could be pregnant. </p>

If  you have had a new sexual partner it is important to let us know.  It is also important to know what makes it better or worse. This information along with an exam, lab test and sometimes and ultrasound can diagnose most causes and allow effective treatment to relieve your pain</p>

        <p>A work up usually involves lab tests of hormones and a semen analysis to rule out male factors which are found in 40% of infertile couples. A test to confirm that the Fallopian tubes are open should also be performed. Treatment often involves taking medication to improve ovulation or the sperm count and motility.</p>
        <p>Intrauterine insemination of sperm can also be performed. If a tube is obstructed, surgery may be performed. In-Vitro fertilization (IVF), in which the egg and sperm are brought together and fertilization take place outside the woman's body can be performed to bypass obstructed tubes.   The fertilized egg or embryo is then placed back inside the woman's body. IVF can also be used to improve fertility if less invasive treatments are not successful.</p>

      <p class="bold">First Trimester</p>
      <p>First Visit 6-8 weeks</p>
      <p>We would like to see you for your first visit as soon as possible, usually 6-8 weeks from your last normal period.  At that visit, we will review your history and perform a physical exam.  An Ultrasound is done to confirm the due date of your baby and look for signs of problems.</p>
      <p>Please do not take any medications that are not prescribed or listed below.  Anytime you are prescribed or given a medication, please remind the caregiver that you are pregnant or after pregnancy if you are breastfeeding. </p>
      <p>The following medications are alright to take for a  few days or occasionally:</p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
              Tylenol for headaches or mild pain
          </li>
        <li>Claritin in AM or Benadryl in PM for congestion
        </li>
        <li>Maalox, Tums or Pepcid AC for reflux or heartburn
          </li>
          <li>Colace or Milk of Magnesia for constipation
            </li>
            <li>Imodium or Pepto Bismol for diarrhea
              </li><li>Chloroseptic or Sucrets for a sore throat
                </li>
        </ul></p>
        <p>Do not use Ibuprofen products or any prescription medications without consulting us.     Never hesitate to consult us about your medication questions.</p>
        <p>Second visit :</p>
        <p>About 12 weeks gestation (twelve weeks from your last period)  we will obtain your prenatal lab panel. You will meet with the physician and discuss the course of your prenatal care. This is a time to bring your concerns and questions so we can form a partnership in planning your pregnancy.  You will receive a folder of educational material that you will be able to refer to throughout your pregnancy.  </p>
        <p>We know how special pregnancy and birth are for each individual mom and it is very important to us to try to help you achieve the experience you are looking for.</p>
        <p>It is not unusual to have spot bleeding in the first trimester, especially after intercourse.  If this occurs, please call us to see if further evaluation with an ultrasound is warranted.</p>
        <p>As part of our prenatal testing testing we offer testing looking for birth defects such as spina bifida chromosomal abnormalities that include blood tests. We also offer special ultrasounds that show the thickness of the skin of the babies neck (nuchal translucency) looking for signs of Down's Syndrome and Turner's Syndrome.</p>
        <p class="bold">Second Trimester: </p>
        <p>In the second trimester, we will see you every 4 weeks if there are no complications.  Between 18-20 weeks is the best time for an ultrasound to look at the anatomy of the baby.  It will also check on the growth of the baby, confirm its gender and access the fluid around the baby. </p>
        <p>At about 28 weeks we will screen for gestational diabetes as many gestational diabetics have no risk factors. </p>
        <p class="bold">Third Trimester:</p>
        <p>In the third trimester, from 28 to 36 weeks we will see you every 2 weeks to continue checking blood pressure, weight gain and fetal growth by measuring of fundal height.  Ultrasounds for growth  and tests for fetal well being such as Non stress test or Biophysical Profiles will be done as needed.</p>
        <p>rom 36 weeks on, you will be seen weekly.  This is the time you will let us know your wishes for labor and delivery including methods of pain relief, positioning, breastfeeding and if you are having a boy, circumcision.  We will answer all your questions in these areas and make a personal plan for your delivery.</p>
        <p>We recommend "kangaroo care" or "skin to skin" immediately after your baby is born to improve breastfeeding, your babies growth, neurological  development, and sleeping.  This involves lying the baby on your abdomen when he/she deliverers, cleaning them off as we wait to cut the cord and then placing him/her on your chest after drying, stimulating and accessing your baby.  The first hour is a unique experience and is a wonderful chance to bond and improve your baby's health.  Dad can do "skin to skin" too! </p>
        <p>"The first hour of life outside the womb is a special time.  This once in a  lifetime experience should not be interrupted unless the baby or mother is unstable and requires medical resuscitation.   It is a "sacred" time that should be honored, cherished and protected whenever possible." (Raylene Phillips, MD, FAAP)</p>
